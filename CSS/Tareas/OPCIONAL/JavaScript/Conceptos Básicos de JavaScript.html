                <h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular
                    for a variety of reasons. It is a small and
                    lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
                    JavaScript lives inside a host
                    environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these
                    environrnents to provide programmatic control over
                </p>

                <li > <span class="tit"> <a href="">Variable Declaration</a> </span> JavaScript variables
                    are
                    containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a
                    variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique
                    names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></li>
                <li >
                    <span class="tit"><a href=""> Variable Assignment</a></span> operators assign values to
                    JavaScript
                    variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, givin our variable a value to hold. The =
                    assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span > var x = 10;</span>
                </li>
                <li > <span class="tit"> <a href="">Data Types</a></span> Data types are important
                    concept;
                    to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that
                    are
                    JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span >true</span> or <span>false;</span> null -
                    <span >null</span> aka nothing; Number -
                    <span>42</span> or <span > 3.14159;</span> String -
                    <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array -
                    <span>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span>{first_name:'Jane',las_name:'Doe'}</span>
                </li>
                <li > <span class="tit"><a href="">Conditionals </a> </span> When you write code, you
                    want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based
                    on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to
                    accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span>
                    a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block;<span> else if
                    </span>to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;<span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                <li > <span > <a href="">Loops</a> </span> There are many different kinds of
                    loops
                    in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an
                    action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four
                    times and then you stop. Thats a loop!</li>
                <li >
                    <span > <a href="">Function</a> </span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code
                    block.
                    When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions.
                    As
                    an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual
                    and
                    get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up.
                    Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our
                    function over and over again.
